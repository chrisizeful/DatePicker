### DatePicker
TODO

### Installation
Copy DatePicker from the addons folder into the addons folder of your project. Read more about installing and enabling addons [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html). The C# version is alternatively available as a Nuget package. Note that to use the demo you will have to **git clone** the repo, since the artifact is setup for use with the Godot Asset Library.

### Licensing
DatePicker is licensed under MIT - you are free to use it however you wish. The font used is Google's [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
