### DatePicker
DatePicker is a themed Godot calendar addon inspiried by the Windows 11 calendar. Two new types are added to Godot: DatePicker and Calendar. DatePicker is a Button that when clicked displays a Calendar. When a date on the Calendar is selected, the Calendar is hidden and the text of the DatePicker button is updated. The header of the Calendar (i.e. 2025 or March 2025) can be clicked to toggle between the year and month views.

### Installation
Copy DatePicker from the addons folder into the addons folder of your project. Read more about installing and enabling addons [here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html). Note that to use the demo you will have to **git clone** the repo, since the artifact is setup for use with the Godot Asset Library.

### Licensing
DatePicker is licensed under MIT - you are free to use it however you wish. The font used is Google's [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).
